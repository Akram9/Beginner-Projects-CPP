## Project List
(projects are ordered by increasing difficulty)

 - [Palindrome Checker (Number)](https://github.com/rsz/Beginner-Projects-CPP#palindrome-checker)



##### Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. First you have to convert the number to backwards, then compare the new number with original one





## Solutions
These solutions are by no means the only (or ideal) way to complete any of these projects. They are there to serve as samples that meet at least the minimum necessary criteria to be deemed as complete. All projects are intended to be completed in Python 3, but most can be done in any language.
